Database Migrations Clarification: Migrations aren't about moving databases - they're for evolving your schema over time. For example, when in Phase 3 you realize you need to add a "notes" column to the programs table, migrations let you update the schema without losing data. Should we use Flask-Migrate (Alembic) for this? It's standard practice and will save headaches during development.
    #ah ok yes, the DB will definitley be added to over time, i have a lot of ideas
Initial Admin Creation: You said "manually create" - should we build a simple seed script that creates the admin/adminpass user when the database is first initialized? Or do you prefer a CLI command you run yourself?
    #Just seed it
Plate Inventory: For gym equipment (Phase 2), what plate sizes should be the default options? Standard set (2.5, 5, 10, 25, 45 lbs) or should it be fully customizable per gym?
    #yes those are deafult plate options, but also people should be able to add any type of work out equipment, from dumbbells to treadmills
Freestyle Workout Logging: When users do freestyle/adhoc workouts, should those be saved to workout history the same way as scheduled workouts?
    #yes saved for sure, and used when reporeting on per lift reports
Exercise Attributes: Beyond just the name, should exercises optionally store: description, muscle groups, equipment needed, difficulty level? (These would help with filtering in the modal search)
    #yes we need all of those Attributes and we will definitley add more
Body Pattern Presets: Should we provide some common body pattern presets (Push/Pull/Legs, Upper/Lower, Full Body) or start completely empty and let users define everything?
    #we can suggesst labels for certain days 
Charts Library: For the reporting phase (volume charts, 1RM progression), do you have a preference? Chart.js is lightweight and works well with Bootstrap.
    #chart.js is good
